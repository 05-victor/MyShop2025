2. **Service Layer** (`IUserAuthorityService` & Implementation)

   - Get effective authorities (with blacklist applied)
   - Check if user has specific authority
   - Add/remove authority restrictions
   - Full audit trail support

3. **API Endpoints** (5 RESTful endpoints)

   - View effective authorities
   - Check specific authority
   - List removed authorities
   - Restrict authority (POST)
   - Restore authority (DELETE)

4. **DTOs** (Request/Response objects)

   - Clear documentation

5. **Testing Suite** (`.http` file)

   - 10+ test scenarios
   - Complete workflow examples
   - Error case testing

6. **Documentation** (3 comprehensive docs)

## 🚀 Next Steps - REQUIRED

### Step 1: Create Database Migration ⚠️ IMPORTANT

Run these commands from your project root:

```powershell
# Navigate to project root (if not already there)
cd "d:\D old\HCM-US\25-26_HKI\WindowProgramming_TranDuyQuang\TestProject"

# Create migration
dotnet ef migrations add AddRemovedAuthorities --project src\MyShop.Data --startup-project src\MyShop.Server

# Apply to database
dotnet ef database update --project src\MyShop.Data --startup-project src\MyShop.Server
```

### Step 2: Run & Test

```powershell
# Run the application
cd src\MyShop.Server
dotnet run

# Use the test file to test endpoints
# File: src/MyShop.Server/Controllers/user-authority-tests.http
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Simple Example:

**Before:**

- User "John" has role **Admin**
- Admin role grants: `[ALL, POST, DELETE]`
- John's effective authorities: `[ALL, POST, DELETE]` ✅

**After Restriction:**

```http
POST /api/v1/users/{johnId}/authorities/removed
{ "authorityName": "DELETE" }
```

- John's effective authorities: `[ALL, POST]` ✅
- DELETE is removed even though role grants it!

**After Restoration:**

```http
DELETE /api/v1/users/{johnId}/authorities/removed/DELETE
```

- John's effective authorities: `[ALL, POST, DELETE]` ✅
- Back to normal!

## 📍 API Endpoints Summary

Base URL: `/api/v1/users/{userId}/authorities`

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/effective`               | GET    | Get user's effective authorities with full breakdown |
| `/check/{authorityName}`   | GET    | Check if user has specific authority (true/false)    |
| `/removed`                 | GET    | List all removed authorities for the user            |
| `/removed`                 | POST   | Add authority to blacklist (restrict)                |
| `/removed/{authorityName}` | DELETE | Remove from blacklist (restore)                      |

## 💡 Use Cases

1. **Temporary Restrictions**

   - Suspend dangerous permissions during investigation
   - Remove DELETE during audit periods

2. **Fine-Grained Control**

   - User needs Admin role but shouldn't delete
   - Give SalesAgent most permissions but not ALL

3. **Security Incidents**

   - Quick response to suspicious activity
   - Remove critical permissions immediately

4. **Compliance**

   - Enforce principle of least privilege
   - Remove unnecessary permissions without role changes

5. **Testing**
   - Test application behavior with different permission sets
   - Simulate restricted users

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Audit Trail**: Every removal includes:

- When it happened (`RemovedAt`)
- Who did it (`RemovedBy`)
- Why (`Reason`)

✅ **Validation**:

- User must exist
- Authority must exist
- No duplicate removals

✅ **Cascading**:

- User deleted → removed authorities deleted automatically
- Authority cannot be deleted if referenced

✅ **Special Handling**:

- "ALL" authority recognized as super admin
- Proper checking logic implemented

---

## 📊 Testing Examples

### Test 1: View Effective Authorities

```http
GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/authorities/effective

Response:
{
  "effectiveAuthorities": ["ALL", "POST"],
  "removedAuthorities": ["DELETE"],
  "allAuthoritiesFromRoles": ["ALL", "POST", "DELETE"]
}
```

### Test 2: Restrict Authority

```http
POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/authorities/removed
{
  "authorityName": "DELETE",
  "reason": "Security review",
  "removedBy": "admin"
}
```

### Test 3: Check Authority

```http
GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/authorities/check/DELETE

Response:
{
  "hasAuthority": false,
  "reason": "User does not have 'DELETE' authority (removed)"
}
```

## 🎯 Key Formula

```
Effective Authorities =
  (All Authorities from User's Roles)
  -
  (Authorities in RemovedAuthorities Table)
```

Special case: If "ALL" authority exists in effective authorities, user has all permissions.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Migration Required**: You MUST run the migration before testing
2. **User ID Format**: Use actual GUID from your database (not the placeholder)
3. **Available Authorities**: POST, DELETE, ALL (from seed data)
4. **Available Roles**: Admin (has ALL), SalesAgent (has POST)
5. **Testing**: Replace `{{userId}}` in .http file with real user ID

---

## 🎊 You're All Set!

The implementation is **complete and ready to use**. Just run the migration and start testing!
